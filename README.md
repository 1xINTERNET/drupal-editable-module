# Drupal editable

> Currently still in alpha stage, so APIs are not yet final!

This module provides commonly used building blocks to progressively decoupled Drupal. It does nothing on its own. For an example how to use it, please refer to the `editable_STARTER_MODULE` sub module. (Better documentation will follow once the API is settled.)

## Installation requirements:

- Make sure you have set up to use composer with [asset-packagist](https://lightning.acquia.com/blog/round-your-front-end-javascript-libraries-composer) (Install into the `/libraries` directory)
- Require this module with composer: `composer require drupal/editable`
