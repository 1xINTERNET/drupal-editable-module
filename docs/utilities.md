# Utilities

Editable (core) exports some commonly used libraries and utilities which can be used by other modules in order to prevent duplicate code.

In addition it also includes these libraries on the `window` object so other modules can reuse these: `React`, `ReactDOM`, `PropTypes` (Only in the develooment build)
